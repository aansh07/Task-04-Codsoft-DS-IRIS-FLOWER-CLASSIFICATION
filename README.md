Task-03:-IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 

🌟 Excited to share my recent project where I developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements! 🌸 Using the widely-known Iris dataset, I implemented a Decision Tree algorithm in Python with scikit-learn to accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

🔍 Key Highlights:
- Utilized the scikit-learn library to preprocess the dataset, split it into training and testing sets, and standardize the features for optimal model performance.
- Trained a Decision Tree model on the training data to learn the patterns and relationships between the features and target labels.
- Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics and generated a detailed classification report to assess its effectiveness in classifying Iris flowers.
- Demonstrated the ability to generalize the model to classify new samples, showcasing its practical applicability beyond the training data.

🚀 This project not only honed my machine learning skills but also provided valuable experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Excited to continue exploring and applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems! 📈💡
